# GhostPing-Repo
 A bot to Ghost-ping the Whole Server when Certain Users Speak
  >"everyone" -GhostPing Bot

  This is a bot I created after I and others received a ghost ping in a server, and I got the idea, "How could I automate this?"

## Setup
  
  1. Download the code from this repository with one of the following
     - Clone this repository using git
     - Download the .zip for this repo
       -If you use this method, be sure to extract the contents from the folder to the desired location
      
  2. Create a new discord bot, or open an existing one
     - Go to the [Discord Developers Application Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
   
  3. Edit the required JSONs
     - Input the token of your bot into token.json
     - Input the user IDs of all the users that you want to trigger the ghost ping
      
  4. Open Command line and start the program
     - Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system, or the program will not run
     - Change your directory to the program folder that you installed
     - run "node ." in the command line

  Congratulations, you now posess the ability to ping everyone, without pinging anyone.
